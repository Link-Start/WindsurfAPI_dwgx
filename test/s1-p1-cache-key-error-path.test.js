// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Gating the cache key on an actual consumer changes one
// edge case on purpose: a body that JSON.parse accepts but cacheKey cannot walk
// (a ~5000-deep nesting blows the clone's stack) used to die inside the key
// computation for every caller. For callers whose key is never consumed — a
// plain API key, the default — the key is no longer computed, so that body now
// reaches the handler instead of failing early. For per-user-scoped callers the
// key is still consumed and the throw still happens, unchanged.
//
// Pinned here so the change stays deliberate: if someone later makes the
// computation unconditional again, this test fails and the trade-off gets
// re-argued rather than silently reverted.
